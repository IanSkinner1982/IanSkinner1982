### Welcome to my github profile

Hi! I'm Ian. 

You can usually find me making software for the Commodore 64 or playing on my DSi. I'm a moderator for a [Commodore server](https://discord.gg/8Dy2h4vHzY) on Discord and a  member of [NCX-Programming](https://github.com/NCX-Programming/). (I wrote the news, the readmes and some of the NCX website.)
If you want to see what I'm currently working on, look [here](https://github.com/IanSkinner1982/Cookie-Clicker-C64).
Also feel free to check out my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/kJac2ty).

Have fun looking around!
