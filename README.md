Hi! I'm Ian. 

You can usually find me making software for the Commodore 64 or playing on my DSi. I know BASIC, HTML, and I'm learning how to use CSS. 
I'm a moderator for a Commodore server a on Discord and a member of [NCX-Programming](https://github.com/NCX-Programming/).
Currently I'm working on Cookie-Clicker-C64 and C64-Title-Loader.
